# Telecom Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a step-by-step process for building a logistic regression model to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset. The following steps are covered:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Loaded the dataset and displayed the first few rows.
   - Handled missing values by converting `TotalCharges` to numeric and dropping rows with missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`.

2. **Building the First Model**:
   - Defined independent variables (features) and dependent variable (target).
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets.
   - Trained a logistic regression model on the training data.
   - Made predictions on the test data.

3. **Standardizing Features**:
   - Standardized the features using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance and convergence.

4. **Feature Elimination using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)**:
   - Used RFE to select the top 5 features that contribute most to the prediction.
   - Trained the logistic regression model using only the selected features.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Generated a confusion matrix and calculated accuracy.
   - Performed manual feature elimination to compare model performance.
   - Calculated sensitivity (recall) and specificity to evaluate the model beyond accuracy.

6. **ROC Curve**:
   - Plotted the ROC curve and calculated the AUC (Area Under the Curve) to visualize model performance.

7. **Finding the Optimal Threshold**:
   - Identified the optimal threshold for classification by maximizing the difference between true positive rate and false positive rate.

8. **Precision and Recall**:
   - Calculated precision and recall to understand the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.

9. **Making Predictions**:
   - Demonstrated how to make predictions on new data using the trained model.

## Repository Structure

- `churn_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `telecom_churn_prediction.py`: The Python script containing all the steps mentioned above.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Ensure all required packages are installed.
2. Place the `churn_data.csv` file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the `telecom_churn_prediction.py` script to execute the logistic regression model and see the results.

```bash
python telecom_churn_prediction.py
```

## Key Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted.
- **Specificity**: Proportion of actual negatives that are correctly predicted.
- **ROC Curve**: Visual representation of the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: A single scalar value summarizing the performance of the classifier.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building and evaluating a logistic regression model for predicting customer churn. It highlights important steps such as data preparation, feature selection, and various evaluation metrics to ensure robust model performance.
